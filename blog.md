title: Validating and identifying patients for Mutual Aid with process mining
---

NHS England National Director of Elective Recovery, Sir James Mackey and National Director of Emergency and Elective Care, Pauline Philip DBE have written to Trusts on 16 August 2022 to increase support for elective recovery on non-admitted pathways.  Trusts are expected to have validation processes that enables the identification of patients, based on a set of eligibility criteria, to access outpatient consultation from alternative providers.
Traditionally, Trusts will conduct ad-hoc analysis of their patient tracking lists (PTL) with the support of their business informatics team based on any given eligibility criteria.

#### When all goes well...
Both the service teams and business informatics teams are able to prioritise their availability to interrogate the PTL, without the need to gather additional information or revise the data structure, the analysis could be completed in hours.
In reality...
Both service teams and business informatics teams are extremely busy and the PTL needs to be manipulated to conduct the relevant analysis.  This could take days or weeks.

#### Top 5 insights from process mining in the NHS
•	Trusts can now adopt process mining analytics to interrogate their PTL or Weekly National Waiting List datasets to identify patients who meet current and any future eligibility criteria in seconds.
•	Trusts can also rapidly uncover bottlenecks preventing patients from progressing through their elective journeys
•	Improve safety and quality of care by comparing all patient journeys to best practice pathways.
•	Never lose a patient again with full transparency and visibility of every patient journey.
•	Remove unwarranted variations in patient journeys and identify process improvement opportunities continuously.

Trusts can also interrogate any additional referral and patient attributes (Illustration B) to support decision making to offer the most appropriate outpatient consultations.

#### How to get started
During the Covid pandemic, the NHS has led the way in their use of data and analytical techniques to support critical decision making.  The NHS is now leading process mining in healthcare with ICSs and Trusts innovating and building capabilities to revolutionise patient flow analytics.

In 2022, AnalystX set up the first process mining community in the NHS to develop the full range of capabilities to enable any NHS organisation trying to accelerate and improve patient journeys using process mining tools and techniques.

#### Getting involved 
If you are already using process mining at your organisation, we would love to hear about your experience and your work, if you would like to learn more about process mining please join our community of practice (AnalystX Process Mining), to receive a live demo or have further questions, please get in touch with a member of the Logan Tod & Co team.
