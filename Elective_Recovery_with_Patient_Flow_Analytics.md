title: Validating and identifying patients for Mutual Aid with process mining
---

This blog post highlights the potential of patient flow analytics, using process mining, to improve elective recovery efforts in the National Health Service (NHS).

### Key findings: ###

* Multiple referrals for the same condition ("scatter gun" approach) by GPs leads to unwanted appointments, hindering overall efficiency.
* Inappropriate referrals due to outdated training or guidelines can be identified and addressed.
* Unnecessary rework in referral services can be reduced, freeing up clinical and non-clinical capacity.
* High volume of "unwanted" activities like DNAs and cancellations can be minimized.
* Inappropriate clinician allocation can waste appointment slots and require rework.
* Uncoordinated scans and tests can lead to appointment cancellations.
* Outdated validation methods using spreadsheets can delay prioritizing patients and risk patient deterioration while waiting.

### Potential Impact: ###

* Implementing these improvements could release significant clinical and non-clinical capacity across the National Health Service (NHS).
* More efficient use of resources can lead to reduced waiting lists and improved patient care.

### Conclusion: ###

Patient flow analytics offers valuable insights into bottlenecks and inefficiencies within the referral process. By addressing the root causes identified, the NHS can move away from activity-focused metrics towards impact-maximizing behaviors, ultimately facilitating sustainable elective recovery.
